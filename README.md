Analysis of Fire and Deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon (1999â€“2019)

This project presents a sample analysis of the impact of El NiÃ±o and La NiÃ±a phenomena, as well as human activity, on fires and deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon between 1999 and 2019.

The analysis is based on the following dataset from Kaggle:  
ðŸ”— [Brazilian Amazon Rainforest Degradation](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mbogernetto/brazilian-amazon-rainforest-degradation)

Key elements of the project:
- Exploration of correlations between ENSO events (El NiÃ±o/La NiÃ±a) and wildfire activity
- Investigation of human-driven deforestation trends over two decades
- Visualizations created using Tableau to present key patterns and insights

This project aims to offer a starting point for further exploration of environmental changes in the Amazon rainforest.
