# SQL-excercise
## 🔍 Project Overview

The objective of this analysis is to examine the impact of **El Niño and La Niña climate phenomena** and **human activity** on **wildfires** and **deforestation** in the Brazilian Amazon between **1999 and 2019**.

The project uses SQL-based queries to uncover relationships between climate events, monthly/annual fire trends, state-level deforestation, and correlations between environmental variables.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **DBeaver** (SQL client) – for writing and executing SQL queries  
- **PostgreSQL** – for managing and querying the database  
- **Tableau** – for creating interactive dashboards  
- **Kaggle dataset**:  
  [Brazilian Amazon Rainforest Degradation](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mbogernetto/brazilian-amazon-rainforest-degradation)

## 📌 Key Insights

- **Wildfire spikes** were observed during **2002–2005** and **2015–2019**, with summer months showing stronger fire activity.
- **States with the highest deforestation** on average: **Mato Grosso (MT)** and **Pará (PA)**.
- **El Niño years** show a **notably higher number of fires** and **greater deforestation averages** compared to La Niña years.
- **Very Strong El Niño** events do not always correlate with higher fire counts than "Strong" events.
- The **year 2004** had the **highest deforestation and fire activity**, despite not being associated with an intense climate anomaly.
- **Correlation observed** between total fire count and total deforested area across years.
- **MT and PA** have the largest percentage share in overall Amazon deforestation from 2004–2019.
